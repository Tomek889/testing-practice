# Testing Practice
This project demonstrates testing in JavaScript using Jest to ensure correctness and reliability of utility functions. It includes tests for string manipulation, arithmetic operations, cipher logic, and array analysis.

## Functions Tested
- `capitalize(text)` – Returns the capitalized first letter of a trimmed string.
- `reverseString(text)` – Reverses the characters of a string.
- `calculator` object – Provides basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
- `caesarCipher(text, shift)` – Implements the Caesar cipher for encoding text by shifting alphabetic characters.
- `analyzeArray(array)` – Returns an object containing the average, min, max, and length of a numerical array.
